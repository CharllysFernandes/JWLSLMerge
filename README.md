# JWLSLMerge
JW Library Sign Language Merge Utility

JWLSLMerge (or JW Library Sign Language Merge) is a utility to merge two or more JW Library Sign Language backup files. The first version of this utility was developed in less than 8 hours due to an urgent need to merge playlists for a theocratic event.

There is still much room for improvement, so I welcome your contributions!

To use, simply enter the following command prompt:

JWLSLMerge.exe "path to file 1" "path to file 2" and so on.

Example:
JWLSLMerge.exe "c:\temp\discurso_182.jwlibrary" "c:\temp\discurso_157.jwlibrary"

Download the JWLSLMerge.zip file from the latest release and run it, following the instructions.
