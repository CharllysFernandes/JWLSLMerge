# JWLSLMerge
## JW Library Sign Language Merge Utility

JWLSLMerge (or JW Library Sign Language Merge) is a utility to merge two or more JW Library Sign Language backup files. The first version of this utility was developed in less than 8 hours due to an urgent need to merge playlists for a theocratic event.

There is still much room for improvement, so I welcome your contributions!

## Usage
To use JWLSLMerge, simply enter the following command in the command prompt:

```
JWLSLMerge.exe "path to file 1" "path to file 2" and so on.
```

```
JWLSLMerge.exe "c:\temp\discurso_182.jwlibrary" "c:\temp\discurso_157.jwlibrary"
```

## Download
