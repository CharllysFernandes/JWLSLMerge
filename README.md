## JW Library Sign Language Merge Utility

JWLSLMerge (or JW Library Sign Language Merge) is a utility to merge two or more JW Library Sign Language backup files. The first version of this utility was developed in less than 8 hours due to an urgent need to merge playlists for a theocratic event.

There is still much room for improvement, so I welcome your contributions!
